# Investigation into the usage of ford bikes at the San Francisco Area

## by Goodness Folayan


## Dataset overview

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. With over 180,000 entries and 16 columns of bike data taken in the month of February 2019 consisting of features such as start and end dates and time, birth years of the users and duration of the bikes' usage in seconds. 


## Summary of Findings

> 1. The age of the users was skewed to the right of the ages distribution between the mid 20's to early 30's age bracket.

> 2. The days of the week with the most usage was on workdays, with usage peaking at 8am and 5pm (A bimodal distribution of the start times). On weekends, the usage was spreadout during the middle part of the day. 

> 3. It is suggestable that the users commutted to work as observed that thesame pattern of usage was seen by those that did not share their bikes for the duration of the trip.

> 4. The male gender type was most dominant while the "subscribers" users type formed a larger percentage of the population of user type. It was interesting to observe that the "other" gender type variable fared better than the others ("males" and "females") for age brackets greater than 50 years of age. 

> 5. Duration of bike usage was predominantly between 5mins to 30mins on bike trips. That can be attributed to the distances between the stations. It is most possible that the distance from one station to another could not be beyond 30mins. As observed that most people that commuted on weekdays did so for mostly that same amount of time.


## Key Insights for Presentation

> Contrary to initial speculations that the duration of the trips was a function of the other variables in the dataset, it was for most trips fairly the same across all variables (5mins to 30mins). 

>As a result it is suggestible this was less a function of leisure or sport and more a function of a basic need for commutation or transportation. This can be attributed to the following reasons:

1.  The distribution of the start times was bimodal at 8am and 5pm. These were the peak times of usage during work days ( Mondays to Fridays).

2. Bike usage during the Weekends was lowest and was evenly spread during the noon part of the day.

3. Subscribers that didn't share their bikes during the trips followed this bimodal distribution of time (8am and 5pm) occurring only on workdays. 

4. The users were mostly between their 20's and 40's, age distribution peaked at early 30's.
